 Responsive Profile Card

This project demonstrates a **responsive profile card** layout built using HTML and CSS. The profile card is designed to display key information about an individual in a clean and visually appealing format. It is perfect for showcasing personal information on platforms like GitHub, personal portfolios, or as part of a larger web project.

## Features
- **Profile Picture**: Displays an image at the top of the card, representing the individual.
- **Profile Name and Title**: Clearly displays the user's name and professional title (e.g., Software Engineer).
- **Description**: A short bio or description highlighting key skills, passions, and expertise.
- **Contact Button**: Includes a contact button that can be linked to an email address or contact form for easy outreach.
- **Responsive Layout**: The card layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Structure
The project consists of:
1. **HTML**:
   - A simple structure with a `profile-card` container that holds the header, body, and footer sections.
   - The `profile-header` includes the profile picture (`moh.jpg`).
   - The `profile-body` section displays the name, title, and description.
   - The `profile-footer` includes a contact button (`<button class="btn">Contact</button>`).

2. **CSS**:
   - External CSS (`styles.css`) is used to style the profile card and ensure a responsive design.
   - Basic styling is applied to elements such as the profile picture, text, and button, with media queries to ensure the card looks great on different screen sizes.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure the profile picture (`moh.jpg`) is in the same directory as the HTML file, or update the `src` attribute to match your file path.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the profile card in action.
4. Optionally, customize the name, title, description, and contact button to match your personal details.

## Customization
- You can easily customize the profile card by editing the HTML and updating the CSS.
- To change the profile picture, replace `moh.jpg` with your desired image.
- Modify the `profile-name`, `profile-title`, and `profile-description` to reflect your own details.
- The `Contact` button can be linked to a contact form or email by updating the HTML button or adding JavaScript.
